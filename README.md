# Overview
Up until the point of this project I have had no cloud database experience. The limited database I had was just prior to this project where I learned SQL to build a simple local database. With this project I learned how to connect Firebase to a Create React App using Bootstrap for CSS. I also learned how to use Routes to move between pages.

This software has a very simple frontend view that provides the purpose of showcasing the backend processes. The first page an unregistered user will see is the log in page where they can enter a username and password. If they don't have an account, they can sign up by clicking the link at the bottom. If they forgot their password, they can click the forgot password link to send an email to the respective email with password reset instructions. Firebase handles majority of the backend. This project helped me understand how to connect the frontend to the backend but not necessarily how to build the backend infrastructure.

# Cloud Database

The database I am using is Google Firebase. I utilized the authentication feature so that user accounts could be created and authenticated when logging in to the web application.

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code to write the code, Firebase to host the accounts and authentication methods, Create React to build the framework of the app, and Bootstrap as my CSS framework.

# Useful Websites

# Future Work

In teh future, I hope to actually get the Google Firestore portion of the Firebase software to associate specific data to their respective users.

- Implement Firestore datbase.
- Add pages to handle more than just update the user profile.
